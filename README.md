## 1. Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, healthcare apps play a crucial role in managing health records, booking appointments, and providing online consultations. This portfolio showcases various algorithmic solutions implemented in C++ to enhance functionalities within a healthcare app similar to Practo.

## 2. Why Portfolio

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of applying advanced algorithmic techniques to solve real-world problems in healthcare management. It highlights the practical implementation of algorithms to optimize various functionalities such as doctor search, appointment booking, and symptom checking.

## 3. Objectives

The main objectives of this portfolio are:

- To demonstrate the use of algorithmic problem-solving techniques in healthcare applications.
- To provide efficient solutions for common healthcare app functionalities.
- To illustrate the application of data structures and algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## 4. Design

The design of this portfolio involves selecting specific functionalities within a healthcare app and applying relevant algorithms to optimize their performance. Each functionality is paired with an appropriate algorithm and is demonstrated with C++ code examples. The following functionalities and algorithms are covered:

### 1. Doctor Search by Specialty
For searching doctors based on their specialty in a large dataset, a linear search is inefficient. The best approach would be using a Trie data structure, which allows for efficient prefix-based searching. Here is my code for the Trie data structure.

### 2. Appointment Scheduling
For scheduling appointments without overlaps and managing peak times, simple scheduling algorithms may fail. The best approach would be using Interval Scheduling Maximization, which optimizes the number of non-overlapping intervals. Here is my code for Interval Scheduling Maximization.

### 3. Patient Record Management
For managing and retrieving patient records efficiently, a linear search would be too slow. The best approach would be using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Here is my code for BST implementation.

### 4. Symptom Checker
For analyzing patient symptoms and suggesting possible conditions, a basic lookup method is inadequate. The best approach would be using a Decision Tree, which allows for efficient and interpretable classification. Here is my code for Decision Tree implementation.

### 5. Prescription Management
For managing and retrieving prescriptions quickly, searching through a list is too slow. The best approach would be using Hash Tables, which offer average O(1) time complexity for lookups. Here is my code for Hash Table implementation.

### 6. Emergency Response System
For providing quick access to emergency services based on location, simple routing methods are inefficient. The best approach would be using Dijkstra's Algorithm, which finds the shortest path in weighted graphs. Here is my code for Dijkstra's Algorithm.

### 7. Medicine Availability
For checking the availability of medicines in various pharmacies, a sequential search is impractical. The best approach would be using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all nearby pharmacies systematically. Here is my code for BFS.

### 8. Disease Outbreak Prediction
For predicting potential disease outbreaks based on symptoms and locations, a simple heuristic is not enough. The best approach would be using K-Means Clustering, which groups similar data points together. Here is my code for K-Means Clustering.

### 9. Health Monitoring
For tracking and monitoring patients' health vitals over time, simple averaging methods are inadequate. The best approach would be using Time Series Analysis, which captures temporal dependencies. Here is my code for Time Series Analysis.

### 10. Dietary Recommendations
For suggesting personalized dietary plans, a basic recommendation system is insufficient. The best approach would be using Collaborative Filtering, which personalizes recommendations based on user similarity. Here is my code for Collaborative Filtering.

### 11. Insurance Claim Processing
For efficiently processing insurance claims, a straightforward approach may not scale well. The best approach would be using Dynamic Programming to optimize the process and reduce computational redundancy. Here is my code for Dynamic Programming.

### 12. Healthcare Provider Ratings
For analyzing and displaying healthcare provider ratings, a simple average is not enough. The best approach would be using Sentiment Analysis to extract insights from patient reviews. Here is my code for Sentiment Analysis.

### 13. Patient Queue Management
For managing patient queues in clinics, a first-come-first-served approach may be inefficient. The best approach would be using a Priority Queue to handle patients based on urgency. Here is my code for Priority Queue.

### 14. Medical Image Analysis
For analyzing medical images for diagnosis, basic image processing techniques fall short. The best approach would be using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which excel in image recognition tasks. Here is my code for CNN.

### 15. Symptom Tracking Over Time
For tracking changes in symptoms over time, basic methods may not capture trends accurately. The best approach would be using the Sliding Window Algorithm to analyze data within specific intervals. Here is my code for the Sliding Window Algorithm.

### 16. Healthcare Resource Allocation
For optimizing the allocation of healthcare resources, simple heuristics may be inefficient. The best approach would be using Linear Programming to find the optimal solution under given constraints. Here is my code for Linear Programming.

### 17. Remote Consultation Matching
For matching patients with doctors for remote consultations, a random assignment is inefficient. The best approach would be using the Stable Matching Algorithm to ensure optimal pairings. Here is my code for the Stable Matching Algorithm.

### 18. Patient Health Score Calculation
For calculating a health score based on various parameters, simple summation may not be accurate. The best approach would be using the Weighted Sum Model to account for different factor importances. Here is my code for the Weighted Sum Model.

### 19. Genetic Condition Prediction
For predicting potential genetic conditions based on family history, basic probability methods are inadequate. The best approach would be using Bayesian Networks to model conditional dependencies. Here is my code for Bayesian Networks.

### 20. Medical Expense Forecasting
For forecasting future medical expenses for patients, basic trend analysis is insufficient. The best approach would be using the ARIMA Model (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting. Here is my code for the ARIMA Model.

## 5. Challenges

Implementing these algorithms in a healthcare app comes with several challenges:

- **Efficiency**: Ensuring the algorithms run efficiently given the potentially large dataset of patient records and symptoms.
- **Scalability**: Designing solutions that can scale with the growing number of users and data.
- **Accuracy**: Maintaining high accuracy in functionalities such as symptom checking and prescription management.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrating these algorithms into the existing app infrastructure.

## 6. To-Do

To further enhance this portfolio, the following tasks are planned:

- Implementing additional functionalities using more advanced algorithms.
- Optimizing existing algorithms for better performance.
- Extending the use cases to cover more aspects of healthcare management.
- Providing a comprehensive analysis of the time and space complexity for each algorithm.
- Developing a user-friendly interface to demonstrate these functionalities in a live healthcare app prototype.

This portfolio serves as a testament to the power of algorithmic problem-solving in improving healthcare applications, ensuring better management and user experience.
