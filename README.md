## 1. Introduction

In today's world, healthcare apps play a crucial role in managing health records, booking appointments, and providing online consultations. This portfolio showcases various algorithmic solutions implemented in C and C++ to enhance functionalities within a healthcare app. I got the idea of healthcare apps from Practo. i have  did research about practo and find out the functionalities practo is implementing. My idea is to make a health app that provides functionalities of practo and add some additional features that may improve the app. This app will be useful for both doctors and patients.

This app not only facilitate easier access to healthcare services but also contribute to better health outcomes by providing timely medical advice, tracking health metrics, and maintaining comprehensive health records. By using algorithmic problem-solving techniques, we can further enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of these apps, ensuring they meet the evolving needs of users.

## 4. Design

The design of this portfolio involves selecting specific functionalities within a healthcare app and applying relevant algorithms to optimize their performance. Each functionality is paired with an appropriate algorithm and is demonstrated with C and C++ code examples. I have written some codes and some of them i have gathered from various internet resources The following functionalities and algorithms are covered:

### 1. Doctor Search by Specialty

For searching doctors based on their specialty in a large dataset, a linear search is inefficient. The best approach would be using a Trie data structure, which allows for efficient prefix-based searching. Time Complexity and Space complexity is O(number of words * maxLengthOfWord). Here is my code for the [Trie data structure](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/trie.cpp).

### 2. Appointment Scheduling

Efficiently manage appointment scheduling to optimize healthcare provider availability and patient convenience. Traditional methods may lead to inefficient scheduling and patient wait times. The best approach would be using the Min-Heap data structure, which allows for efficient retrieval and insertion of appointments based on priority, such as urgency or patient condition severity. Time Complexity is O(n*logn) and space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Min-Heap implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/min_heap.cpp).

### 3. Patient Record Management

For managing and retrieving patient records efficiently, a linear search would be too slow. The best approach would be using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Time Complexity and Space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [BST implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/bst.c).

### 4. Prescription Management

For managing and retrieving prescriptions quickly, searching through a list is too slow. The best approach would be using Hash Tables, which offer average O(1) time complexity for lookups. Here is my code for [Hash Table implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/hashing.cpp).

### 5. Emergency Response System

For providing quick access to emergency services based on location, simple routing methods are inefficient. The best approach would be using Dijkstra's Algorithm, which finds the shortest path in weighted graphs. Time Complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/dijkstras.c).

### 6. Medicine Availability

For checking the availability of medicines in various pharmacies, a sequential search is impractical. The best approach would be using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all nearby pharmacies systematically. Time Complexity and Space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [BFS](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/bst.c).

### 7. Patient Queue Management

For managing patient queues in clinics, a first-come-first-served approach may be inefficient. The best approach would be using a Priority Queue to handle patients based on urgency. Time Complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Priority Queue](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/priority_q.c).

### 8. Symptom Tracking Over Time

For tracking changes in symptoms over time, basic methods may not capture trends accurately. The best approach would be using the Sliding Window Algorithm to analyze data within specific intervals. Time Complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1). Here is my code for the [Sliding Window Algorithm](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/sliding_window.cpp).

### 9. Insurance Claim Processing

Efficiently process insurance claims while minimizing processing time and maximizing accuracy. Traditional methods may struggle with the complexity and volume of claim data. The best approach would be using a Graph-based approach, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, to optimize the routing and processing of claims through the insurance network. Time Complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(n). Here is my code for [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/dijkstras.c).

### 10. Healthcare Resource Allocation

Optimize the allocation of healthcare resources such as staff and equipment to meet patient demand efficiently. Simple heuristics may lead to suboptimal resource utilization. The best approach would be using a Max-Flow Min-Cut Algorithm, such as the Ford-Fulkerson method, to maximize resource allocation while minimizing costs and bottlenecks. Time Complexity is O(V * E^2) and space complexity is O(V). Here is my code for the [Ford-Fulkerson algorithm implementation](https://github.com/saisudheerp/Aps_portfolio/blob/main/Codes/ford_fulkerson.cpp).
